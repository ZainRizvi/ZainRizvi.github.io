title: Dealing with Information Overload
---

How can we deal with information overload?

Focus on the context that information is being given in.

Ask yourself:
* How valid are the beliefs being presented?
* Is there an agenda behind this information?
* Is this information stale or out of date?
* How does this relate to other information I have?
* What assumptions am I or others making? Are they valid?
