Key quotes:

"the skillful management of attention is...the key to improving virtually every aspect of your experience."

"'The best moments usually occur when a personâ€™s body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile.'... this mental state \[is\] Flow"

# Rule 1: Work Deeply

## Deep Work Philosophies

* Block of a day of deep work every week
* Block of a few hours every day
* Take advantage of deep work opportunities whenever you find yourself with some free time

## How to do it - The 4 Disciplines (4DX)

### 1. Focus on the Wildly Important

Instead of trying to stop yourself from focusing on distractions, instead try to find something that you are really interested in so that your attention naturally goes towards it

"To win the battle for willpower, don't try to say 'no' to the things you want to avoid. Instead try to say 'yes' to the subject that arouses terrifying longing, and let that terrifying longing crowd out everything else"

### 2. Act on the Lead Measures

Measure your success by lead measures - items that imply you will be successful - instead of lag measures, which are items that say you've succeeded.

Lead measures are behaviors that will drive success on the lag measures.

Examples of lead measures:

* Hours spent in deep work
* Mini tasks completed (scrum style)

### 3. Keep a Compelling Scoreboard

People play differently when they're keeping score

Examples:

* Number of hours spent in deep work per day/week
* Number of lead measures

You can corroborate these scores to how high a score was needed to achieve specific goals

### 4. Create a Cadence of Accountability

Have regular meetings of any team that owns a wildly important goal.

This could be you yourself setting up a time (weekly or daily) to go over the past weeks scores and plan how to improve the next week.

## Be Lazy - it helps with Recovery

### Have a Shutdown Ritual

At the end of your workday, have a shutdown procedure so that your brain can stop thinking about what you still need to do. This frees your brain up so that it can rest and recover in the evening.

The process should be:

First, ensure every incomplete task, goal, or project has been reviewed and that for each you have confirmed that either

1. You have a plan you trust for its completion
2. It's captured in a place where it will be revisited when the time is right

When you're done, have a set phrase you say that indicates completion (e.g. "Shutdown complete")

# Rule 2: Embrace Boredom

When you concentrate on something regularly every day (e.g. prayers) you are building up your concentration muscles which will help you have laser focus in other areas of your life.

## Don't take Breaks from Distraction, take Breaks from Focus

Schedule the occasional break from focus where you can give in to distractions. This also helps you train to delay gratification.

Distractions are things like:

* Email
* Internet use of any kind (you can define specific kinds of internet use as acceptable)
* 

### Implementation tips

1. If you need that distraction (like email) frequently, then schedule shorter, more frequent, "distraction" breaks
2. Absolutely no distractions during the distraction free time
   * Must resist temptation, even when it seems important, this is training your brain
3. Schedule distraction time at home as well as work

## Work with great Intensity

Take your goals, estimate how long it'll take to complete, and give yourself a drastically reduced deadline. Commit to it publicly if possible, and then work intensely to make it happen

## Meditate Productively

1. Be Wary of Distractions and Looping
   * Distractions: thinking about other things besides the really important goal you have
   * Looping: Going over the same problem again and again, rehashing old results without diving deeper into it
     * When you notice the loop, catch yourself and shift your attention to the next step
2. Structure your Deep Thinking
   * Example structure:
     1. Carefully review the relevant **variables** for solving the problem and store them in memory
     2. Define the **next-step** question you need to answer using those variables
        * Now you have a specific target for your attention
     3. **Focus** on your question and try to find an answer using the variables
     4. **Consolidate** your gains by reviewing clearly the answer you arrived at

# Rule 3: Quit Social Media

Social media is a tool, it has both positive and negative effects

**The Craftsman Approach to Tool Selection:** Identify the core factors that determine success and happiness in your professional and personal life. Adopt a tool only if its positive impacts on these factors substantially outweighed its negative impacts

## Apply the Law of the Vital Few to Your Internet Habits

1. Identify the main high-level goals in both your professional and personal life
2. For each, list the two or three most important activities that help you satisfy the goal.
   * The activities should be specific enough to allow you to clearly picture doing them, but general enough to not be tied to a one-time outcome
3. Consider the network tools you currently use
   * For each, ask whether the tool has a substantially positive, substantially negative, or little impact on the above identified activities.
   * Only use tools that are substantially positive

**The Law of the Vital Few:** 80% of the effect is caused by 20% of the possible causes

Quit Social Media for 2 months and see if anyone even notices.

## Don't Use the Internet to Entertain Yourself

Make deliberate use of your time outside work

### Put more thought into your leisure time

Think ahead how you want to spend you free time later that day/on a future day

Structured hobbies can be useful, ex. Reading, coding, etc

# Rule 4: Drain the Shallows

The shallow work that increasingly dominates the time and attention of knowledge workers is less vital than it often seems in the moment. Replacing shallow work with deep work == profit

(Note: there is a limit to how much shallow work you can actually cut out)

Deep work is cognitively exhausting. In the beginning, an hour a day is a reasonable amount of deep work time. Experts can do up to four hours, but rarely more.

The rest of the time can be spent in shallow work.

## Schedule Every Minute of Your Day

At the beginning of each workday, divide your day into blocks and write what activity you'll be doing in each block.

Issues that'll come up: your estimates were wrong, and other obligations/interruptions will come your way unexpectedly

That's okay, just remake your schedule the first chance you get. It's okay if you have to redo your schedule a dozen times a day

Tactic: add overflow conditional blocks, blocks where you were doing Activity A before and you'll continue doing it if it takes longer than expected, but if you finish A then you'll do Activity B instead

Tactic: use a task block liberally which is for handling generic things that need to be done (email, interruptions, etc)

This doesn't have to be rigid, if it makes sense to deviate from the schedule then do so. **It's a way to make you think "what's the best thing I could be doing with my remaining time?"**

## Quantify the Depth of Every Activity

Scheduling your day lets you choose how much time to spend in shallow vs deep activities, but you need to identify which is which

**Shallow work:** Noncognitively demanding, logistical style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend not to create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate

Rule of thumb for classification: how long would it take to teach a college hire without specialized training in this task to do this work?

## Ask Your Boss for a Shallow Work Budget

Ask: what percentage of my time should be spent on shallow work?

Answer generally tends to be 30-50% range

Asking the boss for a budget gives you cover when you have to turn down projects

## Finish Your Work by Five Thirty

**Fixed-schedule productivity:** have a firm goal of not working past a certain time, then work backwards to find productivity strategies that allow you to satisfy this declaration.

* You drop what can't be done, and find ways to maximize what you want to do given your limited time budget

Tactic: set drastic quotas on the major sources of _shallow_ endeavors while protecting the _deep_ efforts

* Be asymmetric in the culling your activities to make the fixed-schedule productivity work: cut the shallow while preserving the deep
* Limits to time necessitate more careful thinking about your organizational habits, leading to more value produced

This is a **meta-habit** that's simple to adopt but broad in impact

## Become Hard to Reach

### Tip #1: Make People Who Send You E-mail Do More Work

Tactics:

* Make it harder to find your email address
* Sender filter: Publicly proclaim conditions attached to you reading/responding to their email (e.g. it must be on this topic)

### Tip #2: Do More Work When You Send or Reply to E-mails

Instead of sending a quick response to emails, send a more detailed and more thought out reply that includes more information that the other person was likely to ask you for anyways. This will cut down on the number of replies you'll have to deal with.

Prompt to answer:

What is the **project** represented by this message, and what is the most efficient (in terms of messages generated) process for bringing this project to a successful conclusion?

Your response should:

* Describe the process identified
* Point out the current step
* Emphasize the next step (and potentially the steps after that)

A good response will not require any further responses from you and will allow the recipient to complete the "project"

**Tactic:** To make the email seem less dry and technical, you can have a conversational part at the top, followed by a section labeled "Proposed Next Steps" that's more dry/technical

### Tip #3: Don't Respond

**The Professorial E-mail Sorting:** Don't reply to the email if it is any of the following:

* Ambiguous or otherwise hard for you to generate a reasonable response
* It's not a question or proposal that interests you
* Nothing really good would happen if you responded, and nothing really bad would happen if you didn't respond
