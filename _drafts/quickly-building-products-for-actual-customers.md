_This is my_ [_tweetstorm_](https://twitter.com/ZainRzv/status/1248271817258622978) _on key aspects to focus on when you're building a SaaS service. It details how features that seem critical may not actually be that important.  Experiment to see what your **actual** customers are demanding, and focus 100% of your effort on that._

 

1/ @Google SREs released a free book on Building Secure and Reliable Systems

[https://landing.google.com/sre/books/](https://landing.google.com/sre/books/ "https://landing.google.com/sre/books/")

It's a great book, but not all the requirements of a huge international company with 100,000 employees will apply to your company

Carefully pick & choose what's relevant to you

2/ Sometimes you need to see what your customers actually care about (e.g. better security vs shiny new feature)

Based on their desires, toiling to plug FOO security holes may lead to a secure product which runs out of cash before it could make money

3/ Unpopular opinion:

This is what Zoom did. They deprioritized security in favor of the features _their customers_ voted for with their wallets.

Reliability and Ease of use were the two biggest ones

Back then anyways

Not working on security was a form of Technical Debt

4/ And now it's time for them to pay off that Technical Debt since their customers are actually asking for that now

(and again voting with their wallets)

But note that Zoom was unlikely to even reach this stage if they hadn't placed their bets where they did the past few years

5/ Deliberately choosing what "best practices" you spend your time and effort on implementing and which ones to ignore for later is how you get Technical Debt

And like Financial Debt, it can be good for you as long as you weight the costs carefully

6/ Tech Debt buys you Time + Opportunity

Spend it on MVPs, validating your solutions are what your customers actually care about

And then go sell it to them

7/ Part of that is validating that what you're building is a thing you customers will actually yank out their wallet for and throw it at you

(Nice-to-have's don't cause this effect)

A common Failure Mode: Confusing your Users for your Actual Customers

[https://twitter.com/ZainRzv/status/1218564839112507392](https://twitter.com/ZainRzv/status/1218564839112507392 "https://twitter.com/ZainRzv/status/1218564839112507392")

8/ This process of focusing all your efforts on exactly the things your customers actually want is what @b0noi calls User Oriented Development Process

[https://uodp.club](https://uodp.club "https://uodp.club")

("User" means "Customer" thereðŸ™‚)

9/ Another Failure Mode: Trying to scale waaaay beyond what's actually needed

[https://twitter.com/ZainRzv/status/1220021216708136960](https://twitter.com/ZainRzv/status/1220021216708136960 "https://twitter.com/ZainRzv/status/1220021216708136960")

10/ So what should you focus on? It depends on *your* situation!

If your customers care most about security, focus on that

If they want reliability, give them that

If they just want to watch cat videos then move fast & break things

Your job is to:

1. Offer
2. Discover
3. Adjust
4. Repeat
