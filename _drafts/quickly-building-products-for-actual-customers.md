_This is my_ [_tweetstorm_](https://twitter.com/ZainRzv/status/1248271817258622978) _on key aspects to focus on when you're building a SaaS service. It details how features that seem critical may not actually be that important.  Experiment to see what your **actual** customers are demanding, and focus 100% of your effort on that. It's okay to acquire technical debt along the way_
