# Why do we need to as questions?

The economic model of the world is shifting. The nature of knowledge, work, and employment is changing.

* What business are we in now? Is there still a job for me?
* Is "knowing" obsolete in the age of Google?
* How do you move from asking to action?

## A Questions Life cycle

1. **Why** is something the way it is? Learn about the problem
2. **What If** something was done differently? Generate ideas for improvements or solutions
3. **How** can this idea be implemented?
4. **Implement** the solution

# The Power of Inquiry

Asking questions is now more important than knowing

Everything starts with "why?"

# Stage 1: Why?

* Why does this situation exist?
* Why is it a problem?
* Why does it create a need or opportunity?
* Who is it a need/opportunity for?
* Why has no one addressed this yet?
* Why do I want to spend more time thinking about this?

When you have a question, let it brew in your head.  It'll lead you to [combinatorial thinking](https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/08/14/how-einstein-thought-combinatorial-creativity/) where you draw connections between it and other things you know or learn.

# Learning to Question. Teaching to Question.

* Can a school be built on questions?
* Can we teach ourselves to question?
* How can we make "being wrong" less threatening?

Teaching Style: Activity-Permissive Education

* by Mayo Clinic
* Lets kids move as they learn

## How parents can teach their kids to question

* Ask the kids open ended questions
* Get the kids to ask you questions (and guide them to certain questions)
  * Don't answer those questions. Instead explore through experiments or personal experience and have the kid form a hypothesis about the answer
* When kids come home from school, ask them "Did you ask a good question today?"

## Question Formulation Training

This is a strategy that has been successfully used in classrooms 

1. Give a premise (e.g. "torture can be justified")
2. Stage 1: Divide people into groups to **Brainstorm** questions
3. Rules:
   1. Write each question down
   2. Don't debate or try to answer questions
   3. Just keep trying to think of more questions
4. Stage 2: **Improve** the questions by converting open questions to closed and vice versa. For example you'd change between "why is torture effective" <==> "is torture effective"
   1. This shows that the same question asked differently can make you think in a different space
5. Stage 3: **Prioritize**. Identify the top 3 questions to move the discussion forwards
   1. It Teaches: How to analyze questions and find ones to pursue further

Question Teaching Process

1. Teachers design a focus for the questions
2. Students produce questions
3. Students improve their questions (open vs closed)
4. Students prioritize their questions (top 3)
5. Students and teachers decide on next steps for acting on those questions
6. Students reflect on what they've learned

Imagine: What if the teacher was willing to ask questions that they themselves don't know the answer to?  If the class is interested then..."Lets figure this out together"

# Breaking Down the Innovation Question Process

Why? What if? How?

## To get a Good **Why** Question

1. Step back
2. Notice what others miss
3. Challenge assumptions (including your own)
4. Get a deeper understanding of the situation/problem
