title: 3D Modeling like a Noob
---

You just got a shiny new 3D printer (or you have access to one) and you're ready to print eerything you'll ever need.  Now what?  That was me pretty recently.

You can start off by heading over to [thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/). They have a bunch of cool things you can download and print.

But you don't want that, you want to make your own goodness.  You have a few options:

#The Easiest - [Tinkercad.com](https://www.tinkercad.com/)
[Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/) has a pretty easy to use 3D modeling system that runs completley in your browser. It's pretty nice for making some quick shapes and hacking your initial models together.

Or hacking other people's models together. How?

If you can find 3D models that others have created that you want to change a bit, you can import their STL files into tinkercad and do a quick hackjob to edit them up and present your own creation.

For example, I wanted to create a watering spout that I could add to a milk jug to water my plants.

Instead of designing the whole thing from scratch, I found a model for a [watering spout for a 2 liter bottle](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:9535), a model that included [the lid for a gallon jug](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:560010), loaded them both into tinkercad and combined them to create the watering cap I wanted: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2320492
