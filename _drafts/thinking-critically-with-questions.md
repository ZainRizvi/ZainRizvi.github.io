title: Thinking Critically with Questions
---

How to use questions to learn deeply, think critically, and be creative.

This is post is meant to extract the real juice out of Warren Berger's excellent book _A More Beautiful Question_.  Almost everything in this article was sourced from that book with some analysis/ideas of my own sprinkled in.

# Why Should I Bother With Questions?
We tend to think of knowledge as the most valued asset.  From business to classrooms to game shows, knowing facts is considered proof of someone's status.  But in the Google age where facts can easily be looked up, is that still a valuable skill to have?

What about in this era of alternative facts, where you can find "facts" to support any position you want?.  How do we prevent [confirmation bias](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/science-choice/201504/what-is-confirmation-bias) or deliberate manipulation by others from limiting our world view?

In the age of automation, with AI just around the corner, is there a way to stay gainfully employed doing something that won't simply be taken over by AI?

Building the muscles to ask better questions will help you think through problems from more angles, evaluate information you're presented with more critically, and inspire you with the creativity to change the world (or at least your corner of it).

Being able to ask questions is now more imporant than "knowing" the answer. And the question asking process begins with the question "Why?"

# The Inquisitive Process

The process starts with you noticing a problem and asking the question **Why?**. You then move on to coming up with ideas for solutions, wondering **What If?**. Next you try to see **How?** you could implment one of those ideas, repeating those last two steps until you finally arrive at a **Solution**.

## 1. Why
Here you're learning about the problem.

## 2.  What If?
Generating ideas for solutions to the problem

## 3. How? 
How can you implement one of those ideas?
