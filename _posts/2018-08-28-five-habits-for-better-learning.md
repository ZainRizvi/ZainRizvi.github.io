When presented with any new information think about:
1. **Evidence**: Why do you think this information is true or false? What should count? What do you think you know and why?
2. **Viewpoints**: How would this look from other perspectives? How would other people or companies think about this differently?
3. **Connections**: Noticing any patterns? Have you seen something like this before?
4. **Conjecture**: What if something about this was different? How would that impact things? 
5. **Relevance**: Why does this matter?
