I'm Zain Rizvi, a software developer in the [Microsoft Azure Web Apps](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/websites/) team (formerly known as Azure Websites).

I'm interested in web development and work hard to be a [Lazy developer](http://blog.codinghorror.com/how-to-be-lazy-dumb-and-successful/). In case you couldn't tell I'm a big fan of [Jeff Atwood](http://blog.codinghorror.com/).

Shout out in the comments if you have topics about Azure Web Apps or cloud computing in general that you'd like to hear more about.

You might find a few interesting projects on my [Github](https://github.com/ZainRizvi).
