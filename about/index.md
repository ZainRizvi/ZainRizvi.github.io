I'm Zain Rizvi, a Software Engineer at Google working on the [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/)'s [AI Platform Notebooks](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform-notebooks/). Previously I was part of the the [Microsoft Azure App Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/web/) team, and before that I worked on Windows.

I'm interested in cloud services, AI/ML, finding creative ways to solve customer problems, and work hard to be a [Lazy developer](http://blog.codinghorror.com/how-to-be-lazy-dumb-and-successful/). In case you couldn't tell I'm a big fan of [Jeff Atwood](http://blog.codinghorror.com/).

Shout out in the comments if you have topics about Google Cloud, Azure Web Apps or cloud computing in general that you'd like to hear more about.

You might also find a few interesting projects on my [Github](https://github.com/ZainRizvi).
