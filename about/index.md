I'm Zain Rizvi, a Software Engineer at Stripe. In past lives I've helped develop [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/)'s [AI Platform Notebooks](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform-notebooks/) and Microsoft's [Azure App Platform](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/web/). I even worked on Windows when I was a wee lad.

The topics I'm most interested in include a few different fields, but a high level overview would include:
* Tech industry:
  * It's business strategy
  * Mindsets for engineering effectively
* Personal psychology:
  * Introspective analysis
  * Productivity hacking
* Business & startups:
  * Practicing rapid experimentation
  * Seeing things from the customer's point of view and solving their *actual* problems

If any of the above sounds interesting to you you may want to join my newsletter to get the best articles I find on those topics as well as any insights I write about. You can also find me posting on twitter as [@ZainRzv](https://www.twitter.com/zainrzv)
